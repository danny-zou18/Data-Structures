DESCRIPTION OF 3RD STATISTIC:
My custom statistic answered the question of "How significant is the "home field advantage"?".
Do teams win more when they are playing on their home field? If so, how much more are they winning?
To answer these questions, I needed to record games teams won at home and games teams won while away separately. Then I calculated the percentage difference between those two values and I can say that on average, teams definitely win more when playing on their home field. There wasn't really anything challenging or interesting about the statistic I did except for the fact that implementing it was actually a lot easier than I thought it would be.
