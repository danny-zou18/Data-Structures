TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your implementation?
First, when I get an error, I just write a bunch of print statements to see what is going on. If I cannot figure out
what is going wrong and what values are wrong with the print statements, then I just moved on to using VScode debugger to 
try to figure out where it is going wrong and what I have to fix. At the end, I just used Valgrind to fix any memory errors
and that is about it.
